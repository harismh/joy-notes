# joy-notes

Here are my notes from studying Joy of Clojure, the second edition. All the comments, including REPL evaluations, are mine. There are some very minor edits for Clojure 1.12. The rest of the code is credited to the original authors. 

nREPL can be started via tools.deps: `clj -M:nrepl`.

You can buy a copy of the book here: https://www.manning.com/books/the-joy-of-clojure-second-edition.
